# InertiaNode Starter Kits

This repository contains examples of how to use [InertiaNode](https://github.com/InertiaNode/adapter), an [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/) server-side adapter for Node.js.

## Get Started

To create a new project using InertiaNode, run the following command:

```bash
npm init inertianode@latest
```

This will create a new project with the name you provide.

You can choose between a React, Vue, or Svelte project for the front-end.

You can choose between a Express, Hono (Node), or Hono (Cloudflare Pages) project for the server-side.

## Run the project

Once you have created the project, you can run it using the following commands.

Run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
